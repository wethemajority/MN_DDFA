# The Data Distribution Fairness Act (DDFA)
### A Digital Rights Initiative by *We, The Majority*

The DDFA is a public, citizen-driven legislative proposal designed to modernize Minnesota’s digital privacy and data rights laws. Today, corporations and data brokers monetize our personal information without transparency, consent, or compensation. The DDFA restores fairness by establishing a Digital Bill of Rights and ensuring individuals share in the economic value their data creates.

## 🔍 Why the DDFA Matters
Personal data has become one of the most profitable resources in the world — yet the people who generate that data receive none of its value. The DDFA introduces:

- **Transparency** on what data is collected and how it is used  
- **Access & deletion rights** for personal data  
- **Opt-in only** consent for data monetization  
- **Fair economic participation** when data is monetized  
- **Algorithmic accountability** and human review rights  
- **Statewide data broker registration**  
- **Stronger breach notification & security standards**  
- **Attorney General enforcement + private right of action**

Minnesotans deserve clarity, control, and compensation.
