📘 MN_DDFA — Data Distribution Fairness Act (Minnesota)
A Digital Rights Movement Protecting Minnesotans’ Data, Privacy, and Economic Value

The Data Distribution Fairness Act (DDFA) is a citizen-driven legislative proposal designed to establish a Digital Bill of Rights in Minnesota, regulate the monetization of personal data, and ensure that individuals benefit fairly from the economic value their data creates.

This repository hosts the public landing page, official proposal PDFs, signature progress widget, and public materials supporting the DDFA.

The DDFA establishes:

Transparency mandates
