# The DDFA — Data Distribution Fairness Act
### A Digital Rights Initiative by *We, The Majority*

The DDFA is a public-led legislative proposal to establish a Digital Bill of Rights in Minnesota, regulate data monetization, limit harmful profiling, and ensure that individuals share in the economic value created from their personal data.

The DDFA is grounded in:
- **Fourth Amendment** protections from unreasonable digital search/seizure  
- **First Amendment** rights impacted by algorithmic filtering  
- **Fourteenth Amendment** equal protection and due process concerns  

These principles are outlined in the official proposal PDFs (included).
