      <h2>Digital Bill of Rights (Under the DDFA)</h2>
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>Right to clear transparency about what data is collected and why.</li>
        <li>Right to access, correct, and delete your personal data.</li>
        <li>Right to opt-in before your data is monetized or sold.</li>

    <!-- WHAT IT DOES -->
    <section class="card fade-in delay-3">
      <h2>What the DDFA Does</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        The DDFA builds guardrails around the surveillance economy and
        flips the default from “collect everything” to
        <strong>“respect people first.”</strong>
      </p>
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>Establishes enforceable digital rights in Minnesota law.</li>
        <li>Bans harmful profiling and opaque behavioral scoring.</li>
        <li>Requires strong security standards and fast breach notification.</li>
        <li>Forces data brokers to register, disclose their practices, and face penalties.</li>
        <li>Demands transparent accounting when personal data is turned into profit.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- WHY IT MATTERS -->
    <section class="card fade-in delay-4">
      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        Minnesotans never voted to have their lives turned into products.
        Yet our clicks, locations, purchases, and behaviors are quietly
        bought, sold, and profiled every day — often without our knowledge
        or consent.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        The DDFA restores digital self-determination. It protects vulnerable
        communities, reduces exploitation, rebuilds trust in technology,
        and ensures that when data creates value, the people creating that
        value are not cut out.

    <!-- HOW TO HELP -->
    <section class="card fade-in delay-5">
      <h2>How You Can Help Right Now</h2>
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Sign and share the petition</strong> — every signature builds
          visible momentum.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Send the PDF</strong> to your state representative, senator,
          and local officials with a short note asking them to review it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Print flyers or handouts</strong> with the QR code and pass
          them out at community spaces, libraries, campuses, or events.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Share on social</strong> with the message:
          <em>“If companies profit from our data, we deserve rights and a fair share.”</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
        This is a citizen-driven initiative. There is no corporate sponsor,
        no PAC, and no lobby backing this — just people who are tired of
        being treated as data points instead of human beings.
